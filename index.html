        <h2>Developer/Engineer</h2>
        
        <p>Hi, I am John Sheerin, Welcome to my website. I am a future developer/Software engineer. Currently I am a student with Code Nation on the final week of their 3 week coding course. after this course I plan to move into full time work as either a junior engineer or developer, or possibly move on to the Code Nation Software Master course. On this website you will be able to find information about me and the work that I have completed with Code Nation. This website is week 3's task and I have included widgets to allow you to play the python games that me and my team worked on during the second week.</p>

            <p>Broke for luck was the group project that me and 4 others worked on during our second week on the Code Nation 3 week course, it is the story of a former professional gambler who returns to Las Vegas after many years away and is caught up in a casino heist when the reality of vegas hits hard, just like the old times.</p>
            <p>below you will be able to play the Full game that was created, on the about page you will be able to play the Mini- games that I built for Broke for Luck along with the full code of how they were made. </p>
