        <h3>Why I Joined Code Nation</h3>
        <p>I was presented with the chance to join Code Nation by my work coach, I have previously had the desire to study coding but always put it of as it seemed to a mammoth task to take on alone. when the option to join a course that teaches coding, particually Python, I jumped at the chance to learn. I went into the course blind and found myself to be a quick study with python and HTML. I studied IT during my time in High School but felt as though they were wasted years as we did no coding but we did make a game and a website. We made the website using Microsoft FrontPage, which was already discontiniued software when we learned to use it. During the second year we made a game using a Flash media creator, which became discontinued 2 years after finishing High School. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text2">When the oppornunity came along to study the kinds of thing I wanted to do in High School, I couldnt pass up this chance.</p>
